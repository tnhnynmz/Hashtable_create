The first time that I saw the frog I was sitting in class Its face was pressed up to the window next to me from the outside I had been drawing in my notebook but once I noticed it I could not stop looking It could not stop looking at me either if it had been a staring contest I would have lost Maybe frogs blinked but with its big eyes smushed against the glass this one did not Stagwood Forest was just beyond the school yard and it was riddled with frogs but they always avoided people I knew right away in a way that I can think better than I can say that this frog was different

Miss Weaver had not noticed She would been my teacher for a few months and was known for having a stack of black hair that rose a foot above her head Before the school year started I had heard rumors about her and within a week I realized that they were all true For one thing she wore the same outfit every day the colors changed but she always had on striped pants and a striped jacket For another thing she was mind numbingly boring The kind of boring that makes your eyes shut without your permission Part of the problem was that she liked to tell pointless stories instead of teaching She was obsessed with telling stories about former students who had become famous The first couple of times were not bad even kind of interesting but by the second week of school she had already started repeating herself just like with her outfits 

I knew all the stories by heart The professional football player who was good at math the politician who was a teacher pet I knew every word Instead of listening I spent most of class drawing I drew imaginary places and designed creatures to fill them Every drawing had a story But not that day I had barely gotten started when the frog appeared and changed my life forever

I tried to listen back in to Miss Weaver just in time to hear the end of her story about Martin Shandals the now famous comedian Martin had transferred schools half way through the year so I always felt like that one should not count We were supposed to be learning long division but something had reminded her of Martin I knew exactly what bad joke she would end the story with and much less about long division 

Whenever he acted up in class I would say we have got a real comedian on our hands do not we And I was right she said with a giggle 

I was sure Miss Weaver would see the frog eventually but she did not Nobody did When I looked again to see if it was still there I noticed something shiny It made me forget all about class and Miss Weaver and Martin Shandals There was no denying it the frog had put on a tiny pair of glasses 

I wanted to lecture it to explain that frogs do not wear glasses It bothered me that it did not already know that On top of that it had been staring at me for at least five minutes It seemed like it was bordering on rude Could a frog even be rude I was not sure But the bigger question was why it was so interested in me

I was not the type of kid who got attention Teachers always wrote needs to participate more on my report cards with a smiley face to make my parents feel better I never got into trouble and barely ever stood out on purpose A few years earlier I accidentally peed my pants because my zipper had gotten stuck in the bathroom at the last moment I tried to convince everyone that I had fallen into a puddle at recess The custodian Mr Salazar charged outside with a mop and brought me to find the puddle My guess is that we wasted an hour looking around at the gravel My mom dropped off some new clothes and nobody really noticed my wardrobe change or that it had not rained in weeks 

That how it was Whether I did something spectacular or sneezed myself out of a chair nobody cared and almost nobody said my name As far as school was concerned all those things had happened to some kid So why would a frog with glasses jump up on a windowsill to stare at some kid 

Teachers on the other hand were different Once her story ended it had not taken Miss Weaver long to realize that I was not paying attention She called me up to the blackboard to make an example out of me 

Since you do not feel the need to listen why do not you solve a problem on the board instead she said sitting down at her desk 

My stomach did a flip The problem would take a minute or two to solve and being in front of the class always made me nervous How could I be expected to do anything when there was a spectacled frog staring me down

I stood to the right of the equation on the board so that I could check on the frog with quick glances Despite the distraction I did my best to focus Halfway through I saw that the frog had moved towards the front of the classroom It stopped at the window by Miss Weaver desk It took me a moment to figure out what it was doing I could not believe what I was seeing It was trying to lift the window 

Focusing on the problem became almost impossible I made a mistake and then quickly erased it The next time I looked over the window was open Why should that surprise me Of course a frog with glasses would also be super strong The window was only open an inch but that was enough for it to slip through I dropped the chalk and some of my classmates laughed Bending down to pick it up I tried convincing myself that when I stood back up again the frog would be gone It not there I just think it there

When I straightened up the frog was sitting on Miss Weaver left shoulder This was a brave frog Her head blocked the class from seeing it and I realized that I was still the only one who could Either the frog was real or my imagination had outdone itself It was not all that surprising that Miss Weaver did not feel it there because the shoulder pads inside her jacket were large and fluffy I had heard that she rested her head on them like pillows during her breaks So now there was a frog sitting on Miss Weaver shoulder and nobody else knew it And I was supposed to be doing math

Now that it was closer I could see the frog better It did not look like some new species of frog to me It looked like every other frog I had seen except for the glasses I wondered if they made contacts small enough for a frog But it was not the right time to worry about frog vision That a job for a frog eye doctor anyway

I had daydreams all the time when I was drawing and sometimes I got lost in them I tried one last time to explain the frog away by saying it had to be part of an elaborate daydream I concentrated hard finished the problem and put the chalk down The frog could not be real I shook my head confidently 

When I turned to Miss Weaver I saw the frog look me square in the eyes and nod A moment later it disappeared into Miss Weaver hair 

I did not see the frog for the rest of the day Maybe it stayed in Miss Weaver hair or maybe it jumped back through the window when I was not looking All day long I expected her to find it and scream but she never did 

 

When the bell rang I ran out of the school onto the side of the yard with bushes I had seen frogs hide in there before but there was no sign of it Truthfully I would not have known what to do with the frog if I had found it Would I capture it Would I ask it questions If I was caught talking to a frog outside the school I think people might finally start to remember me but in a talk to the frog kid kind of way 


I liked most of the kids in my class just fine but I was only really close with one His name was Soy and he was definitely without a doubt my best friend Soy had kind of reddish blond hair and a round face He and I had been friends since preschool and I knew that I could talk to him about anything The downside to that was that he also felt he could talk to me about anything Since he had eight older brothers and two older sisters his questions were always about things that I did not understand 

Here how it would usually go Soy brothers would talk about older kids things and then make fun of him for not getting it He would ask me about it and we would look it up It only took a few Google searches for me to get banned from using the Internet with Soy 

The bottom line is that if I was going to tell anyone about the frog it would be Soy I decided that our walk home would be the most opportune time 

Did you see anything outside today during math I asked Soy as we started walking 

What do you mean Like in the sky he asked jumping over cracks in the sidewalk 

I mean right outside the window Like right up against it I answered
Like a person he asked still hopping 

Soy sat in the row farthest from the window so it was possible but unlikely for someone to walk by without him noticing 

No It more like I saw a frog up against the window I explained
Awesome he said
Yeah but this frog was not normal It opened the window and it came in the classroom and jumped on Miss Weaver shoulder and it jumped inside her hair I spit out 

Soy stopped jumping and looked at me That happened today he asked 

Yeah I mean I am pretty sure And when I thought I might be making it up the frog nodded at me I said 

Soy looked confused I thought I heard something move in the tree above us but Soy answered before I heard it again 

It nodded at you I do not even think frogs have necks do they said Soy
This one did I guess I mean most frogs do not wear glasses either but this did I explained
All of a sudden Soy seemed a couple steps further away 

The frog was wearing glasses he asked suspiciously
Yes I shot back
Why would someone go around putting glasses on frogs he asked

I dunno maybe it bought them itself I replied 

Soy was standing at least twenty steps away now 

Totally Well maybe Miss Weaver will let us look in her hair tomorrow and we can ask the frog where it got them So I think I am just gonna head back home today instead of coming over My mom has lots of stuff for me to do See you later Soy said turning to run away 

Soy I yelled Stop right there I can prove the frog is real 

 

How he asked
It sitting on your backpack I said

Soy had the frog in his hands within seconds He was always good with outdoorsy stuff like that His mom was usually busy with his siblings so Soy was left to play outside a lot By third grade he had caught a pet turtle salamander and flying squirrel Unfortunately his older brothers Rick and Hank stole the squirrel and kept it in their room Once a week they played a game where Rick threw the squirrel from the second story window and Hank caught it midair with a trash can as it glided down Soy tried to get them to stop but they never listened 

 

The frog did not put up much of a fight I started to wonder if it actually wanted to be caught 

Do you believe me now I asked
Soy peaked inside his hands and then lifted his head Well this frog is wearing glasses Ill give you that

Both of our minds were racing with questions
Let bring it to my treehouse so we can figure this out I said 

 

I had built most of the treehouse in my backyard myself My mom and dad insisted on one of them being there when I used certain tools but that was about it Building things always made me feel good afterwards and I had gotten pretty good at it The treehouse had been done for a while but there were still a few things I wanted to add to it before winter  

 

When we got there I told Soy to use the elevator It was really just a rope with a weighted pulley system but I called it the elevator anyway We used it when we needed to carry things that we could not bring up on the ladder I climbed up and then lowered it down for him All those years of critter handling had paid off and he got it inside the treehouse without any problem I shut the door and quadruple locked it so that the frog could not run away and also to give us some privacy 

 

Okay Soy I said let him loose 

Soy lowered his hands and opened them letting the frog hop to the floor of the treehouse I had a small drafting table drawings and bits of wood all over which provided plenty of places for the frog to hide Luckily for us it did not move at all 

Instead it looked up at me and in a loud voice said What do you mean him
Soy fell backwards from a crouch onto his rear The frog was looking right at me waiting for an answer but all I could do was shake my head
It rude to assume I am a he do not you think I happen to be female said the frog proudly Soy was now holding his head with both hands 

It can talk he said in disbelief
Well now calling me an it after I just told you I was a girl is just plain inconsiderate Soy she said 

 

I knelt down closer looking for anything that might make sense of it all Maybe the frog was a robot But nothing about the way it moved was robotic And would a Made in China sticker really make me feel better Itshe had just called my best friend by his first name Soy was so flabbergasted that he was gnawing on his backpack strap so I doubted that they had met before 

 

I am sorry I said to the frog kneeling down we did not mean anything by it Truly
The frog hopped even closer and said You have always been kind then whispered it a powerful thing Remember that
I will I said amazed that I had just gone from meeting a talking frog to taking advice from a talking frog in a matter of seconds 

But um if you do not mind me asking how is it that you can talk I said 

By that point Soy had half of the backpack strap in his mouth 

The frog crooked her head at me slightly Do you think that humans are the only animals that can talk she asked 

I was startled Was it possible that animals could talk and somehow no one in the world knew about it Was everything that I thought about animals wrong I took a seat on the floor too Soy spit out his strap 

That not cool he said I tell my pet iguana all of my secrets If he can talk I need to know who he been talking to
The frog gave out a little laugh then she said Oh I am just kidding Animals ca not talk any more than humans can flap their arms and fly 

I was embarrassed but mostly relieved 

What about some kind of iguana sign language asked Soy still nervous 

Ignoring Soy question I asked the frog How is it that you can Talk I mean 

For starters I am not a frog she explained The only reason that I— 

Without any warning there was a knock on my treehouse door 

What are you up to in there Why is this door closed asked my mom sternly
I searched my brain for an answer that did not have the word frog in it 

Soy and I were um we were doing homework and the breeze kept blowing our papers away I replied
He a clever one the frog whispered to Soy 

 

I gave the frog a signal to be quiet It may have been the first time in the history of the world that a frog had spoken but for the time being she needed to stop If my mom heard a female voice she would break down that door quadruple lock or no I added another lock every time she broke down the door A few weeks earlier Soy had lit a firecracker inside the treehouse and she had noticed the smoke I added the fourth lock that night but was more sure than ever that metal was no match for mom strength For the moment I needed this frog vocabulary to shrink back down to ribbit 

 

Well come on inside the house There a man from the school board here who needs to speak with you my mother said Then she lowered her voice and spoke softly into the crack of the door and he looks pretty official He even wearing a fancy suit with a shiny yellow bowtie Do not worry though he assured me you have done nothing wrong 

Yellow screeched the frog
What asked my mom
Oh I said Hello I lied using the best high pitched voice I could muster
Honey Hello usually comes at the beginning of conversations Were pretty far into this one she said
Ah right I just sometimes forget when you are supposed to say it I said nervously 

Oh I did not realize Maybe we can work on that sweetie she said getting even closer to the door because that definitely a problem Just hurry up and come down please 

 

I heard my mom climb down the ladder and then watched her go back inside the house The frog jumped up to the open window which faced the woods behind my house I was amazed at how high she could jump It was immediately clear that she could have left any time that she had wanted 

Whatever you do do not mention me the frog whispered frantically Ill find you later 

And with that she jumped out the window into a bush below

I sent Soy home and told him not to say a word until we could come up with a plan He was too frazzled to argue Soy walked home along the path behind my house that crossed the woods to his while I headed inside When I slid the back door open I saw my mom and the man in the bowtie sitting in our living room She sat by the fireplace and he sat closest to the front door My mom and the man were mid conversation when I walked in He looked at me from the corner of his eye but kept speaking 

 

Theyre absolutely beautiful Mrs Caelum I do not believe I have seen lilium bulbiferum that vibrant since my last trip overseas said the man as he touched the lilies that were on the table between them
Oh you are too nice said my mom with a giggle 

 

My mom was not known for giggling but flowers were one of her most favorite things in the world She filled the house with them whenever she could The most that my dad would say about it was that fake flowers cost less 

Does your son have an appreciation for flowers as well the man asked turning to look at me 

His blond hair was pressed firmly against the top of his head and his pale skin looked almost shiny The thing that stood out the most though was his toothy grin I felt uneasy I wished that I was still talking to the frog instead

Ah there you are Come have a seat and say hello to mister my mother said stopping for a moment
Ream he finished for her and it a pleasure to meet you young man
Hello I said 

Good job my mom whispered happily that exactly where a Hello goes Mr Ream is from the school board she said louder and he here to 

Once again she was not sure how to finish her sentence 

I am here to speak with you about Miss Weaver class he interjected we have begun an initiative where we the board members speak directly with students to learn more about their experiences in the school system We would like to have an open dialogue between the administration and the children
I think that just wonderful said my mom 

 

She was smiling ear to ear looking for me to agree I gave a nod then I waited for someone else to speak 

Mrs Caelum we have found that students tend to be more free and honest with their feelings when their parents ca not hear I assure you I have been trained in creating an atmosphere where students can speak their mind without fear of unjust punishment said Mr Ream
I see said my mom She turned to me and spoke in her usual kind voice I am going to be right here in the kitchen if you need anything sweetie Remember that you can be honest with Mr Ream and nothing bad will happen Okay 

I nodded and watched my mom leave for the kitchen I looked at Mr Ream clothing He wore a blue suit with a yellow bowtie It was not a regular yellow though so I could see why my mom had mentioned it As he moved the light reflected off of it in every direction It did not move like clothes usually do In fact it did not move at all I also noticed just how tall Mr Ream was He was taller than my mom even when he was sitting down 

Has anything strange happened at school in the past couple of days he asked right away 

I shook my head hard and fast 

You can tell me I am here to help he said in a friendly voice You see I did not tell your mom this because I did not want to worry her 

Now Mr Ream leaned in closer His mouth looked larger by the second I was almost positive that he could eat a whole sandwich in one bite 

There a he said pausing person who has been bothering students Some little birdies told me that perhaps they have been bothering you  

He gave the largest smile I had ever seen Two sandwiches at least I knew deep down that he meant the frog That why she had acted so funny when she heard about his bowtie 

Well what does the person look like I asked shyly
That the tricky part he replied This person likes to disguise themselves in different ways Ways that might even seem impossible 

He was only a foot away now Three sandwiches and a side of fries I decided 

He continued They may even be disguised as an animal

My eyes got wide Mr Ream got small
You have seen them Mr Ream said trying to hide his excitement 

 

I shook my head 

I did not say that you did I said defensively
But you have have not you he said sympathetically Tell me what happened It for your own safety 

I did not know what to believe
What so dangerous about her anyway I asked 

The moment I said it I wished that I could take it back that I could grab the words out of mid air and zip them right back into my mouth But that not how words work 

Her he said
I could not look at him I had said too much

He spoke sharply in a whisper So it true She has come to see you Tell me why 

I shook my head 

Why did she choose to reveal herself to you Tell me he demanded 

It was nothing I answered despite myself I was just
You were just You were just what he prodded 

I was confused but I knew that I did not want to tell this man anything more And I was not going to make the same mistake twice 

I was just catching frogs in the woods with Soy and we did not know it was a special frog when we caught it I swear and she asked us to let her go so we did I said in one breath 

Mr Ream sat back in his seat and listened to me ramble on
And she made me promise not to tell anyone Am I in trouble I asked pretending to cry 

I had learned how to fake cry the year before when I tried out for a small part in the school play As it turned out the role of Weeping Willow was not even a speaking part It just a tree No crying required Still after forty minutes of standing up on stage not being allowed to move I cried a little anyway 

No he hissed you have just disappointed me I thought for a moment that you were the 

 

My mom walked in smiling with a vase in her hand

Sorry to interrupt but I thought you might enjoy seeing my latest   she stopped when she saw me 

What are you two talking about in here she asked a bit concerned
Oh Mrs Caelum your son and I were just — Mr Ream sputtered
Why is he crying my mom asked more forcefully She rushed to my side to console me
It nothing Mr Ream pleaded sometimes these talks can be emotional and if you would not mind my asking just a few more questions

The tears were flowing more freely now I had become the Weepiest Willow in the world
I would mind she said firmly and if you would like to keep your job youll leave right now 

Mr Ream straightened his jacket and grabbed a briefcase from behind the couch Yes of course Thanks for your time he said
He opened the door and turned to me
Be sure to let me know if your story changes he said with an unfriendly glare

My mom put her arm around my shoulder 

Out she shouted

I spent the rest of the night listening to my mom speak on the phone with people from the school district Apparently Mr Ream was highly regarded but my mom did not care She was beyond angry She yelled at some of the school people and even threatened to call the police once By bedtime she seemed a little calmer 

Whatever Mr Ream wanted with that frog it was not good I decided then and there that I was not going to let him get to her 

 

The next morning my mom gave me an extra long hug and apologized for the tenth time for letting Mr Ream in the house I told her for the tenth time that it was all right Soy and I met in front of my house to walk to school as usual I had not spoken to him since the treehouse but it was immediately clear that he had gotten over the backpack chewing phase 

 

How do you think it learned to talk She I mean How come she could talk he asked Without waiting for answer he continued And how did it know my name She I mean
I do not know same as you I said honestly
What about the dude with the bowtie he asked excitedly 

His name is Mr Ream Soy he knew about her I said
About the frog Soy asked
Yeah He said that he was looking for someone who could disguise themselves as an animal She was right to warn us There was definitely something off about him I said
You did not tell him anything right asked Soy 

I looked down at the ground 

I accidentally let on that I knew her I confessed
You did what Soy said in shock
I did not mean to It came out by accident And then Mr Ream grilled me on why she had come to talk to me Apparently it a big deal that she did
So what would you do Draw him a picture of it and tell him everything Are you recording this conversation for him right now If you are wearing a wire you have to tell me Soy said angrily 

No quit it Soy I said I told Mr Ream that we were catching frogs found her by accident and let her go
Oh Okay that not bad actually Soy said
Thanks I said with my head still hanging 

And if he looks into it at all the story will check out since I do love catching frogs I should catch a few extra this week just to be safe So what now Soy asked
I really do not know but we need to find out why that frog here and why Mr Ream is after her I answered
I am in said Soy I would take a frog in glasses over a man in a bowtie any day 

I smiled It felt good to have Soy on my side 

He lowered his voice a little and asked shyly If we do see it again could you tell it that I have been really good about calling it a she
Sure thing I said promising to lie to a frog for my best friend

The first half of the day was pretty normal Miss Weaver continued a lesson on government and only stopped once for a story 

The legislative branch of the government is important Probably the most important if you ask me As it turns out a former student of mine is actually a state senator and since I was his favorite teacher I can ask him for favors I do not want to brag but he gotten me out of at least twenty parking tickets she said with a proud laugh 

I always wondered how many parking tickets you could get before they stopped letting you park I did not know how to drive yet but of all the things you had to do parking seemed the easiest 

 

I had been too preoccupied to eat breakfast so by lunchtime I was starving Soy and I sat together in the lunchroom everyday but were not picky about which table we used The lunchroom was long and narrow with a dozen brightly colored tables Soy and I sat down at the far end of a skinny blue table as close to the corner as you could get There were at least ten seats between us and any of our classmates which was good because Soy voice was known for being loud So loud that after our third grade spelling bee it was agreed for everyone sake that Soy would never be allowed to speak into a microphone again 

 

How are we going to find the frog he asked
Why are you asking me I have never looked for a talking frog before I said 

Well I have been thinking Frogs like flies right he asked
Yes I replied as I started pulling my lunch out of my bag
And they like ponds Soy added
Yes I said again
Well that something he said
That not a plan though Soy I replied
The rest is on you I spent all morning on that Soy shrieked 

When I reached inside my bag again I stopped trying to think of a plan 

My mom did not really know how to pack a good lunch Every once in awhile she made one so bad that it was completely un eatable and un tradable Still she had never given me anything slimy Never anything wet And definitely never ever anything that moved There was no doubt in mind that my hand was on a frog 

 

It had to be her It was the only thing that made sense Then I reminded myself that none of this truly made sense I tried not to panic but knew that I had to warn Soy from across the table I had to find a way to be discrete The frog sat still breathing in and out from inside my hand 

 

Sheez een my beg I said through clenched teeth 

What did you say Soy asked
I said sheez my beg I repeated 

Huh who seen your pig he said 

No sheez my beg I said slowly
Wait when did you even get a pig Soy asked with his arms crossed You would better let me ride it 

Soy was convinced that you could ride any animal larger than a cat Also sometimes cats My mom had made it clear that Soy was the reason we could never own any pets 

Soy I said unclenching my teeth put your hand in my bag
As he did his facial expression changed
Ohhh he exclaimed it in your bag
The frog must have understood what was going on because she was still waiting patiently 

Let bring it out and ask it some questions Soy said 

The bag moved a little bit 

She I mean Let bring her out he said too loudly
Shh we do not want anyone to hear I whispered trying to think of what to do next 

 

Soy was eating make your own soft tacos that he would bought from the cafeteria They were one of his favorite lunches He still had the ingredients for two more tacos with the tortillas waiting on the side I had an idea but he was not going to be happy with it

Give me your tortillas I said
What Why he said almost hurt
Soy I am sorry I said but I need your lunch
But it soft taco day Soy replied sadly handing them over 

I used the tortillas and our milk cartons to build a small fort for the frog The opening faced me so that only I could see inside I laid my lunch bag down nearby so the frog could see what I had built 

Listen I whispered at the bag when I say so jump out into the fort okay 

There was no reply but I was pretty sure that she had heard Soy and I both looked around trying to seem relaxed The kids who were sitting closest to us had gotten up to talk to the girls sitting two tables over Soy looked left then right and gave a nod 

Now I whispered 

In a quick green blur the frog jumped from the bag to inside the fort She turned around and I saw her glasses It was her She spoke loud enough for Soy and me to hear but nobody else 

 

Are you all right she said What did the man in the bowtie ask you What did he do to you 

He did not do anything to me but he did ask about you I answered
Ream has been on my tail for a while now she said 

Frogs do not have tails said Soy

Nobody respond 

But I did realize something at that moment 

I do not know your name yet I said
You may call me Delilah or Deli for short she replied 

Her face got much more serious as serious as a frog face can get 

It very important that you tell me exactly what you told Ream Can you do that She asked 

Yes I well I accidentally told him that you and I spoke I am sorry I said and I meant it
That all right Deli said it not your fault
Then he asked why you came to talk to me Why did you come to talk to me I asked 

Do not worry about that now she said What did you tell him
I told him that Soy and I caught you by accident and that you told us not to tell anyone I answered
Brilliant she said It wo not hold him off for long but itll confuse him Then what happened 

Then my mom saw that he had upset me and kicked him out straight away I told Deli
Oh she did wonderfully Your mom is a strong one you know she said 

I wanted to know how she would know that but there were other things that I wanted to know more 

Who is he I asked
That she said with a deep breath is a complicated answer
He an alien is not he asked Soy in an excited voice
No he not an alien Deli replied but in a way that did not make Soy feel silly for asking 

It made me like her a bit more 

Can you tell us who he is then I asked
Deli paused for a while before answering He a dragon she said 

 

I was not sure how to respond I thought the word must mean something different than how it sounded 

Technically he the King of the Dragons she added
Soy rolled his eyes 

Thanks for clearing that up he said I was going to guess unicorn Deli could not see his eye roll but Soy tone made it clear that he thought she was delusional
You mean like a dragon dragon I asked
Wait maybe she meant a sea dragon interjected Soy like this guy Ream must be the dreaded King of the Sea Dragons 

Deli was not amused 

I mean dragons she said firmly as in fire breathing hard scaled flying not swimming dragons she rebutted
But I said like I was breaking bad news dragons are not real 

Deli brought one of her frog legs up to her head and smacked it
Listen to me There are things in this world that we do not know until we do she said 

It was a good point and it was made by a talking frog If we were arguing in a courtroom that would have been her Exhibit A 

Okay fair enough But if dragons are real then why has not anybody ever talked about them before I asked
They have You can read about them in hundreds of books she countered
You mean fairytales asked Soy as he raised his head above the fort trying to peek in 

 

Before Deli could say another word a hand hit the table and started tapping its nails Deli tucked herself back under the cover of the fort as far as she could go 

The bell has rung boys said Miss Weaver Lunch is over and Principal Lance would like to see you 

I had completely forgotten about the bell on account of the existence of dragons 

Miss Weaver was not in a good mood She always got that way when it was her turn to chaperone the lunch room I assumed it was because it cut into her shoulder pad naps 

 

Were not done with our lunches Miss Weaver I said politely 

This looks more like playtime than lunch I ca not have you building houses out of food she said struggling to find a reason because because then everyone would want to do it 

Soy was nodding in agreement
It true I am kind of jealous of it myself he admitted
Miss Weaver started walking away to grab one of the garbage cans at the other end of the table 

Deli I whisper shouted she bringing a garbage can You have gotta hide 

Without a word Deli leapt forward A split second later Miss Weaver turned around and dragged the trash can over to us She used one arm to push all of our food into the can That put Soy in a worse mood than Miss Weaver His taco lunch was gone forever Never to be eaten 

Get moving Do not keep Principal Lance waiting said Miss Weaver 

At that moment I did not care about the principal or Miss Weaver I cared about dragons and the frog named Deli inside my shirt

It would be hard to imagine a better principal than Principal Lance He had grey hair down to his shoulders even though he was bald in the front He was the oldest person at Stagwood but he did not act like it I had never heard anyone say a bad word about him and I would not have either Every year on my birthday he called me into his office and gave me a candy bar I know he did the same for Soy who usually finished his before he got back to the class and showed up with chocolate all over his face and probably everyone else in my class Still he had a way of making me feel like I was more than some kid 

 

Principal Lance office was small and crowded with stuff but felt friendly He had stacks and stacks of dusty books that looked like they were hundreds of years old I heard that a girl once sneezed on one of them by accident and it blew away in pieces The way the story goes Principal Lance laughed so hard that he forgot why he had sent for her But as Soy and I walked into his office it seemed less friendly than usual Miss Weaver gave a small awkward bow and left us As it turned out Principal Lance was not alone What I saw first in the chair next to us was a yellowish gold bowtie and then the large grin of Mr Ream My heart sank 

 

Have a seat kids said Principal Lance You have done nothing wrong but Mr Ream has insisted that he speak with you And I insisted on being present And so with all this insisting going on here we are 

I always enjoyed the way that Principal Lance explained things
I had expected Ream to speak to me but he turned to Soy instead 

I do not believe we have met Hello Soy My name is Mr Ream he said 

Hello my name is Soy said Soy
Yes as I said hello Soy said Ream already losing patience 

Soy had a knack for making people lose their patience faster than anyone I would ever met My dad called it impressive My mom preferred not to talk about it 

Hello said Soy a second time
Soy do you know why I am here asked Ream
No Do you know why I am here Soy asked back

Ream was about to lose his cool He turned to Principal Lance 

If you would let me speak with them alone we could be done with this much faster Ream said
As I have told you if you would like to speak with my students youll do it with me present said Principal Lance 

I am here as a representative of the school board Ream said sternly
And I am here as caretaker to these children Unless you are their parent or guardian you may not speak to them without me present Principal Lance said even more sternly 

Soy face was already covered in chocolate from a small bowl that Principal Lance had left unguarded Ream looked over at Soy shuddering at the thought of being his parent or guardian 

This will not be brought up in front of the children again finished Principal Lance  

Very well resigned Ream Soy I need to know if you have noticed anything unusual in the past couple of days 

The conversation was starting just like mine had and that got me worried The longer Ream questioned Soy or me the more chances we would have to slip up again even with Principal Lance there I could still feel Deli inside my shirt and I did not want to think about what would happen if Ream got his hands on her Or if we believed Deli his claws 

Sir may I go to the bathroom I blurted out 

Of course said Principal Lance 

Ream gave the slightest hint of a smile He relished the idea of talking to Soy without me around 

Um also I am not allowed to go without my bathroom pal I said
Pardon said Principal Lance
Miss Weaver told us that we have to go with a bathroom pal if we want to use the bathroom I could get in a lot of trouble if she finds out that I went alone

I realized that I was learning how to think on my feet more and more since meeting Deli It was not the greatest lie ever told but I hoped it would do

Bathroom pal Seems a little unnecessary at your age Bathroom buddy has a nicer ring anyway Well so be it Go on then Soy said Principal Lance 

I nudged Soy before he could object
Yeah said Soy I would better go with him He always gets lost without me 

Soy was the one who had walked into the girls room by accident not once but twice that year already But I was not about to argue with him Not then at least

 

You ca not let them both go said Mr Ream what if they
What if they run away interrupted Principal Lance Would you like me to disable their getaway car just to be safe he laughed Mr Ream when my students need to use the restroom they use the restroom 

He rose and ushered us towards the door
And that goes for their bathroom pals as well he said giving me a small wink

As we walked out I could tell that Ream was upset but he dared not argue against Principal Lance again Ream knew that we were up to something but luckily for us he did not know what Not so luckily for us neither did I 

Walking through the brightly lit hallway I did not stop at the nearest bathroom Instead I kept walking and looked down at the green tiles under my feet wondering what to do next 

Where are we going Soy asked 

I do not know yet I told him 

We passed the library then turned the corner and passed two more bathrooms one for students and one for visitors Either one would have done if I was actually looking for a bathroom At the moment the last place I wanted us to be was somewhere that Ream expected us to be I was pretty sure that if there was a book called Dealing with Dragons Chapter One would be Do not Corner Yourself and Tell the Dragon Exactly Where to Find You or some version of that

What are we supposed to do now I whispered to Deli inside my shirt
You need to get home Deli answered it not safe here anymore 

What she saying asked Soy
She said we need to get to my house I told him
What at your house he asked me
What at my house I asked Deli 

A mop splashed onto the floor and my head shot up to see the custodian Mr Salazar staring at me 

I sometimes talk to my belly button Sometimes I stammered to Mr Salazar

Me too said Soy without skipping a beat
He pulled his shirt away from his body stuck his head down and said Hey little guy come on out and say hi 

Soy bellybutton was sometimes an innie and sometimes an outtie so I wondered if this was actually a conversation that he would had with it before Mr Salazar shook his head and continued mopping in the other direction

I did not want to risk running into anyone else so we snuck into the empty auditorium When I got inside I remembered that there was an exit behind the stage that would lead us straight into the woods During play rehearsals when the auditorium got too hot they opened the door and let the breeze in No sense wasting money on air conditioning Miss Weaver would say She was the self appointed director every year since she knew how to deal with talent 

I was pretty familiar with the stage area Not only had I been the first truly Weeping Willow I had also been a stagehand Soy knew a little about the stage too He had tried out for the lead once but was given the role of a crocodile instead He was mentioned in every review although indirectly Was the crocodile supposed to talk and Why did it have an accent were two of his favorite comments

Now the stage exit was our best shot at escaping without being seen

This way I said hurrying down the side aisle 

The set for the next play was still being built There was a forest and a small hut with pieces of wood scattered all around it I had not paid attention to what the production was since deciding not to try out again Soy had gotten a lifetime ban for his crocodile performance and it would not have been much fun without him 

Soy had told me that he outgrew the theater It was not until I saw BANNED FROM THE THEATER posters with his face on them that I found out the truth

I let Deli out onto the stage and then Soy and I hopped up after her The glowing red exit sign was in sight when we passed the hut but a loud noise from the front of the auditorium stopped us in our tracks

Get down yelled Deli

We crouched behind the flat wooden hut Deli instinctively crouched too which I thought was strange Then I saw the terrible news for myself through a window in the hut It was Ream and he was being escorted down the aisle by Mr Salazar 

They came in here They were acting all odd talking to their tummies said Mr Salazar
Hmm I see Thank you that will be all Ream said with a wave of his hand 

Who did you say you worked for again asked the janitor 

The school board The one that decides your salary replied Ream as he strode down the aisle towards us 

Mr Salazar mumbled something I could not hear and left the auditorium 

Ream was looking down each row of seats as he walked When he was halfway down he started speaking 

I know that you are in here he said
Is he talking to us whispered Soy
We need to get out of here said Deli
Hell see us if we run for the exit I said
We need to find a way to make him angry she whispered 

If he really is a dragon is that such a good idea asked Soy
It the only way Trust me said Deli 

 

I looked around the set I would never set out to make an adult angry before especially one that worked for the school but this was cause for an exception My eyes settled on a handwritten sign that I had seen many times before attached to the switch beside us It read DO NOT TOUCH

I know how I said shakily but hell need to get closer 

Not a problem whispered Soy 

Ream vaulted up onto the stage apparently finished searching the seats He was the tallest person I would ever seen If we did not do something soon he would find us in seconds 

I knew he was hiding something You have been following these two for a few days now Delilah Have you finally found him Ream asked with a villainous grin 

Soy was about to ask a question but Deli quieted him with one look Ream was ten feet away right where the set began 

Whatever you are going to do do it now she whispered 

 

I lunged to the side tore through the warning sign and flipped the switch Ream shot his head towards me with a sinister snarl There was a loud crack from above the stage A wave of red came crashing down on Ream head covering him and the ground completely I was in shock The curtain had fallen directly on him just as I had planned but seeing it happen startled me

Do you think I hurt him I asked
I approached the pile slowly but Deli jumped in front 

No We have to go now she exclaimed 

The pile began to rise from the center It kept growing until it almost reached the ceiling In a burst the curtain was split in two by sharp claws There standing in front of us was the King of the Dragons

HOW DARE YOU said the dragon in a booming voice His scales were bright yellow and shiny like they were wet He was more terrifying than any dragon I had ever seen in drawings His head alone was larger than my whole body 

 

Ream breathed a heavy breath and then let out a puff of steam that blew over me and Deli Soy was still tucked down behind the hut but he said later on that he had felt it too 

Go yelled Deli as she jumped between my legs to lead the way 

The three of us sprinted toward the exit door Soy charged through first and as Deli and I ran behind him I felt more of the steam This time it was much hotter I slammed the door shut behind us and we ran as fast as we could to the tree line I did not stop running until the school was out of sight We hopped over logs and under branches Soy and I both fell more than once but never stopped to look back When we were deep enough into the woods Deli finally told us that it was okay to walk for a minute 

 

Hell have to hide in the auditorium until he can take human form again It takes much more effort to build a disguise than to let your true form show she explained
That was a DRAGON yelled Soy catching his breath
I do not understand what just happened I muttered 

Deli replied Listen boys I know this is a lot to take in but it time that you started believing me It will make this a lot easier 

Slowing up had helped me to calm down and think a little more clearly 

Did you know that he was going to do that Change like that I asked
I was counting on it she said
That was pretty risky do not you think Soy asked angrily Especially since he would have passed right over you and gone for the main course 

We found the worn dirt path that led to my neighborhood It was quiet in the woods except for a few birds 

What happened when you flipped that switch Deli asked
That curtain been broken for two years Miss Weaver told Mr Salazar to fix it but he just put up a sign instead I told Deli She does not mind because without a curtain falling she can bow as many times as she wants when the play is over
Miss Weaver finally did something right then said Deli 

I stopped in my tracks 

How is it that you know Miss Weaver I asked And what did Ream mean back there when he asked if you have found him 

Soy stopped walking too 

Deli replied Okay Ill explain But keep walking We still need to get to your house and it another five minutes away 

I almost asked how she knew that but decided not to bother 

She continued I have been watching Stagwood for a long time My job was to find the hero before Ream did
What do you mean by the hero I asked
Over twelve years ago a hero was born here in Stagwood she answered 

I was born in Stagwood twelve years ago said Soy 

Yes I know Deli responded She was looking at me as she spoke but I pretended to be interested in the leaves at my feet instead 

Do you know who the hero is I asked staring so hard at the leaves that my eyes hurt 

We know that it a boy she said
Well duh interrupted Soy with a proud smile are not most heroes 

Actually no About 51 of heroes are female The males just brag a lot more about it Deli explained with a smaller but louder smile
Yeah well Soy sometimes started a sentence without knowing how to end it Go on he said
As I mentioned we know that he was born here in Stagwood and we also know that it was in the summer she answered
Right and I was born in May I think we have decided that it me said Soy
And when were you born she asked me 

My stare pierced the leaves and was well on its way to the center of the earth 

July I mumbled
Guys guys guys It me said Soy with a hand on my shoulder When you are a hero you can just feel it

For years we were not sure who the hero was because not much else had been written about him Deli told us
Written by who I asked 

Nearby a woodpecker was knocking on a tree I could not see where it was but Deli had noticed the sound too 

The fairies write down the stories The battles between good and evil darkness and light and magic and sorcery are all found in the fairytales she said
Fairies I asked looking at Deli
Of course she said that why theyre called fairytales Fairy tales Who did you think wrote them 

People answered Soy
Deli shook her head People ca not write the way that fairies do Fairies are able to be places without being seen and to know what is happening as it happens They are the first and true storytellers 

Wait are you saying those stories are real I thought out loud
Yes said Deli as I was trying to tell you before the creatures you have read about are real and so are their adventures And the hero of this story has the most important adventure of all ahead of them 

So what is it that the hero has to do I should probably know before I get started with my heroicalisms Soy boasted
Heroics I corrected and this adventure sounds kind of dangerous
Deli eyes became serious behind her glasses It is He will have to face the gravest of foes 

 

Soy had lost his smile He lowered his eyes choosing rocks to stare at instead of leaves Foe like an angry gnome
Afraid not More like a dragon she replied
Soy and I looked at each other You mean Ream He part of the fairytale I asked
Deli nodded and said Perhaps he was not always meant to be but he is now She looked at the trees above us
Guys I have thought a lot about it and I do not think that I am the hero said Soy definitively
Deli smiled It all right Soy she said After years of searching I have already found him
And who is it asked Soy 

Deli shot a glance behind us towards the path

There no time for that now she said Ream has spies all over these woods and we have taken too long Unless my ears are deceiving me theyre getting closer It time to get inside Deli sprinted ahead with long jumps
Soy whispered in my ear Okay she might have a neck but ears She seriously has no idea how to frog

We ran the rest of the way to my house which did not take more than a minute Once we were inside Soy started to make a snack from the fridge This was despite the fact that ever since the Midnight Sleepover Snack Incident of 2012 Soy was only allowed to take food from a special drawer labeled FOOD THIEF

 

My mom had woken up that fateful morning to find our kitchen in shambles At first she blamed my dad then what she estimated must have been fifteen raccoons and then finally Soy He was sprawled out on a pile of containers and wrappers and not nearly enough napkins when my mother came for him Worth it was all he had the energy to say

 

Afterwards my parents and Soy made an arrangement to give Soy his own drawer and only stock healthy food inside That also the reason that I never once saw him open it Sometimes I ate from it to help cover for him

 

Soy now not the time for food I said shutting the fridge

No it all right said Deli Soy I want you to gather as much food as you can carry inside both of your backpacks and then bring them upstairs Anything you want okay

 

Soy was too shocked to speak It was like she had just asked if he would mind testing every toy in the toy store He nodded and drooled a little

I picked up Deli and ran up the stairs to my room Okay were here Now what I asked

Now we get ready for liftoff she said Open that window as far as it will go 

Got it I said

I ran over to the window across from my bed and dresser pulled up the blinds and lifted the glass as high as I could manage

That wo not do it she told me get it higher

I used a baseball bat to get an extra two feet and built a base out of three books and an empty glass to hold it up Deli gave me a little frog nod

I ran back over to her and asked What else do you need for wait liftoff

Soy had to drag the backpacks into my room By the time he got to us his smile looked like it hurt

 

Great work Soy Deli said Now lift them up onto the bed

As Soy heaved the bags up one at a time I heard crinkles and clinking and sloshing My guess was that Soy must have taken absolutely everything in the kitchen except for the contents of his drawer

Do you have a smartphone Deli asked me

 

I opened my desk drawer and pulled out a dark blue smartphone It was a birthday gift from my mom The cover was custom made with a picture of me at three years old with spaghetti all over my face I was pretty positive she had glued it on

Even though I had the phone my parents did not really let me use it much They told me it was only for emergencies and they made sure to check the bill every month On top of that they looked at my text message history every week just to be sure I was not using it improperly Once I used it to vote for my favorite singer on a reality show When my parents found out they grounded me for three weeks They let me off the hook after two weeks but I never got to see the finale

 

Now hop on the bed said Deli

All three of us sat in a row facing the window with Soy in the back with our bags Deli in the center and me at the foot of the bed

What do we do now Soy asked

We have got to fly this bed out of the room she answered

Soy was silent for a moment I decided I am not asking any more questions he said 

How are you going to make a bed fly I asked her

I wo not she said you will

Me I asked with a squeak But I am I ca not even drive yet

Listen your bed already has the magic that you need to make it fly she explained

I have slept in this bed every night and it never once flown I rebutted quickly before Soy could accuse me of holding out on him

 

Deli explained There is a magic in the stories your parents read to you when you were younger and the ones you read to yourself It a form of magic called lore Most of it goes to you and helps fuel your dreams Some of it though falls around you building up inside your bed

Soy was staring at her blankly

She continued Imagine a single flower in a field of dry grass If you watered that flower every single day not only would the flower bloom and grow but the grass surrounding it would become green and strong as well Your bed has been sprinkled with lore growing stronger every night Now it time to use it

I had never heard of lore before and from the look on his face neither had Soy He shook his head as he opened a bag of chips

Nope Nope Nope What you are looking for is an airplane This is a bed He took a bite and made a loud crunch I do sleep on both of them though he said to himself

I put my hand on top of the blanket for a moment Maybe it was time that I started to trust Deli She had warned us that Mr Ream was a dragon and there was no denying that now She had helped us escape and had risked her own skin more than once If she said my bed could fly maybe she was right

 

Okay what do I need to do I inquired 

Wharffs Soy said with a mouth full of chips

Excellent Deli responded First things first pick your steering wheel It can be anything you would like

I picked up the smallest pillow on my bed It was one that my grandfather had made for me when I was little It was dark grey with an apple tree sewn onto the front of it 

Got it I said

Place it in front of you she told me

 

I put both my hands on the pillow in front of me acting like it was a steering wheel Without a noise I felt it lock into place I could rotate it around but when I pushed or pulled it too far it snapped back into position When I let go it hung midair It was like it was held in place by invisible rubber bands

Whoa I said turning back to Soy are you seeing this He nodded with wide eyes

That will do nicely Items with meaning tend to absorb more lore she told me Soy was starting to creep up to watch more closely

Now place your phone down she instructed me

 

I put the phone down on the bed to my left next to the steering wheel and it stuck there The smartphone glowed orange and the screen began to change There were all sorts of gauges and levels on the screen that I had never seen before Most prominent were five buttons

 

CRUISE MODE

SPY MODE

SQUEEZE

NEVER PUSH

and the largest LIFTOFF

 

I was so nervous and excited that I did not realize my mom had come home until I heard the door slam shut

 

What are you two doing here she yelled upstairs Was it a half day today

She had seen the books from our backpacks that were emptied onto the kitchen floor when Soy made room for the food

Deli started to speak faster Do you see the LIFTOFF button Press it now

I pushed the button and the mattress immediately began to shake And then slowly it lifted itself up into the air It was only a few inches off of the frame when it stopped shaking and hovered smoothly My face gave way to an involuntary smile Of all the things that I had seen and experienced that day this was the most amazing We were flying

 

My smile was cut short when we heard the sound of cabinet doors opening and closing with loud bangs

He did it again she yelled He ate it all

My mom immediately started storming up the stairs speaking to herself This time Soy going to replace everything he took How did he even No I do not care how He going to be punished

We do not have time for proper instructions Deli panicked Push the brown button and tilt the steering wheel forward

Okay but it   I began to say

My mom knocked angrily on my door and then started to turn the knob

 

There no time just do it Deli shouted

I pushed my finger down hard onto the brown button labeled SQUEEZE

The sides of the bed shot up towards our heads wrapping us up The door started to swing open I had just enough room to push my hands forward on the pillow In the blink of an eye we shot straight ahead pushed through the window knocking the bat away and popping us out the other side as it shut

 

I could barely hear my mom shouting when she opened the door to an empty room Beds He taking beds now

Our house sat on the forest end of Windfall Drive There were eleven and a half houses on our side of the street and twelve on the other The half was because of a house on the corner of the block owned by two elderly ladies who were both named Miss Trinket They were identical twins and did not seem to like anyone most of all each other Miss Trinket got her mail addressed to Windfall Drive and her sister Miss Trinket insisted on getting her mail addressed to Slope Street According to my dad it all started forty years ago with an argument over who should mow the lawn 

 

Miss Trinket does not think she should do it because Miss Trinket has slightly longer legs than her and it would take her less time However Miss Trinket thinks Miss Trinket should do it because she has a bad back and Miss Trinket does not Ever since the argument started they refuse to live at the same address so Miss Trinket changed hers to Slope Street Understand my dad asked My answer was always no no matter how matter times he explained it 

 

Sometimes their grass would get so long that Soy refused to walk by Who knows what inside there he would say Most likely it was just bugs and maybe snakes and Soy liked both of them Still something about not being able to see inside rubbed Soy the wrong way so we took the long way around or went through the woods instead Besides that there was always a Miss Trinket outside on the porch waiting to get mad about something They yelled at the mailman every single day for scaring their dog Marshall He was a small border collie with white and black hair and he was always laying down next to one of them I sometimes wondered if he could tell them apart If animals really could talk that might have been my first question

 

Once a summer my dad sent me over to mow their lawn for them secretly hoping to make our side of the street an even twelve again he said that the other side of the street looked down on us Mowing their lawn did not make our street whole but it did make me the only person who the Miss Trinkets liked 

They would each make me a lemonade if it was a hot day and deliver it to me when the other one was not around One of the Trinkets made hers too sweet and the other made hers too tart but when I combined them the lemonade tasted perfect The best part was that they always paid me separately as well
Remember I am the nice one a Miss Trinket would say as she handed me money 

Two minutes later the other Miss Trinket would say the same thing and hand me the same amount of money I decided that they were both the nice one partly because it was true but mostly because I had no way of picking

 

Flying on my bed we rocketed down the middle of Windfall Drive past twelve houses to our left and eleven and a half to our right Luckily for us there was only one person outside that day and it was a Miss Trinket with Marshall by her side She was sitting on her porch with a lemonade in hand looking out over a foot of grass 

Marshall lifted his head and wagged his tail as he looked up Miss Trinket gave me a friendly smile and wave as we zipped by her I waved back as best as I could from the smushed bed She put a finger over her mouth to tell me that she knew how to keep a secret and gave a wink Say what you will about a Miss Trinket but they are pretty good people to have on your side when you are flying down the street on a magical bed and do not want it getting back to your mom 

 

Flying was like nothing I would ever felt before It was like being on a roller coaster that jumped its tracks and decided to explore My excitement changed to worry when I spotted the bookstore getting closer and closer I would forgotten that my street ended abruptly at Finnegan Books and we were running out of road It looked like a house but it was one story taller than all the others 

 

Press the button again shouted Deli from behind me 

I looked above me at the smartphone but it was hard to see now I stretched and shimmied until I could just reach it The brown button now read FLOPBACK 

There was not a second to spare as I pushed it The mattress flattened out in an instant The pillow steering wheel was moving easier now so I lifted it slightly as we shot up higher The bookstore was passing safely below us when Soy spoke 

How are you so good at steering he asked me
I do not know I said looking back I am just doing what feels right 

Deli seemed to be smiling but it can be hard to tell sometimes with frogs 

The sky was clear blue as far as I could see I saw the wind blowing crumbs off of Soy shirt We were flying faster and higher by the second 

Keep climbing said Deli 

 

I steered the bed upward until I could see all of Stagwood Forest below us To the west it thinned out and then faded into the slope of Saltridge Hills The forest was thicker to our right where it spread out until hitting Merrywater Creek 

I decided to test out the bed a little more Better to learn how to fly it when there was nothing else around I turned the pillow to the right and the whole bed started to fly right I turned the pillow slightly left and we shifted back When I pushed forward the bed sped up and the wind blew through my hair making my cheeks flap I pulled towards me and we slowed down which made the bed begin to dip Lifting and pushing forward we floated right back up 

I was so focused on learning that I barely felt the tap on my shoulder When I turned around I saw that Soy face had turned green and it looked like he was about to throw up 

I am starting to get car sick he said 

This is not a car reminded Deli 

Soy did not have time for a rebuttal He got sick over the side of the bed I concentrated on keeping the bed straight from then on 

You okay I shouted so he could hear me over his vomiting 

A few moments later he was laying back on the bed You ca not zigzag around like that he scolded me I almost fell off the bed 

I am sorry Soy I answered

I felt pretty bad about making him sick but it felt much worse to think that I had endangered all of us

 

Where am I supposed to be going I asked Deli to change the subject

She hopped over to the phone and looked at the screen I watched her leg stretch out and press the button that said CRUISE MODE A map application came up that looked like one my parents used on their phones all the time She typed out the word Pavidale and entered it 

The pillow popped out of my hands and dropped attaching itself to the bed All of a sudden a see through bright orange shield started to rise from all sides of the bed It locked together above our heads We were completely encased 

Luckily your bed has more than enough lore to spare for the shield too It will make sure that nobody falls off Deli told us happily And Soy if you need to throw up again let me know because you do not want the shield up when you do
And were going to Pardivale I blurted out 

Pavidale Yes Right now it over Iceland she told me 

Right now I asked
Right now she said and left it at that The bed knows where to go It will take care of the rest But remember this the shield is better at keeping things in than keeping things out so pay attention to anything that might get in our path Take back control anytime by pressing the CRUISE MODE button again to turn it off 

Soy reached his arms out wide and looked around What could we possibly hit out here he asked
Birds for one thing planes for another or dark clouds Those would be the worst of all she answered gravely 

What so bad about dark clouds I asked Deli I had a feeling that we would not like her answer 

Dark clouds can be a source of a magic that we call rile Rile is the opposite of lore It fuels nightmares and it gives the worst kind of creatures their magic There no telling what we would find inside if we passed through a cloud with rile she said
Okay I interjected but we learned in school that clouds are just water vapor And that theyre white because of something to do with how they scatter light
We learned that Soy asked
And that dark clouds or rain clouds are only dark because they have more water inside I finished
When did we learn that Soy questioned
Last week That why you should pay better attention in class sometimes I responded proudly
And you looked out the window saw a frog with glasses and got a dragon chasing us on your flying bed That why you should pay better attention in class Soy responded 

Soy must have been saving that one up 

 

That how most clouds work said Deli but these clouds are different They do not operate by the same rules just like a dream does not operate by the same rules as the real world Lore and rile are stronger than you can possibly imagine 

How do we know a dark magic cloud from a regular one I asked
Magic clouds take the shape of something unusual Extraordinary even she answered 

Soy and I both looked around the sky There were no clouds around with interesting shapes And I still had more questions 

Deli if there are clouds with rile inside does that mean that there are clouds with lore inside too 

Deli smiled back at me
That is an excellent question she said
The bed dipped a few feet riding on an air current that was invisible to me 

But I do not have to tell you she said lying back because you are going to find out soon enough 

 

Deli took over a little while later leaving me to patrol the sky until the sun began to set She told Soy and me to get some sleep while we could so we would be rested I tried to remember whether frogs were nocturnal or not Then I wondered whether it mattered since Deli did say that she was not a real frog Those were my last thoughts before drifting off to sleep 

I had not had a nightmare in a long time but that night I did I dreamt about big red dragons who were attacking me from the sky and from underground And then I saw the shape I had been drawing in class when Deli appeared I did not recognize what it was then and I did not even know why I drew it It felt like maybe I had dreamt of that shape once before but I could not be sure Then the shape was floating right above me I hear a thousand small voices shouting for me to grab it It was shining now and I wanted to grab it more than anything I felt the breath of the dragon behind me as I ran towards it But just as I reached out Deli woke me with a startle She said that she had seen something following behind us After we looked more closely we decided that it was nothing 

Probably just a plane passing by she concluded 

I went back to sleep easily The rest of the night I dreamt of flying around the world on top of an enormous marshmallow It was much nicer than the dragon dream By the time the sun rose we were almost there I did not tell Deli or Soy but I knew almost nothing about Iceland When we first caught a glimpse of it I could not believe my eyes I thought it was the most amazing place that I had ever seen There were big green mountains and hills with snow on top We flew over huge lakes and waterfalls cut into the side of rocks and the air smelled nicer than any air from back home 

This reminds me of Scotland Soy said

You have been to Scotland I asked him 

Yep my whole family went when I was a baby he replied proudly
How can you possibly remember it then I ca not remember a thing about being a baby I said 

He put a hand on my shoulder and said Some babies are smarter than others 

I took my position at the head of the bed and Deli jumped up beside me Press the CRUISE MODE button again she commanded I may have been flying the bed but I did not feel much like I was in charge 

Right after I pressed it the bed started to shake The orange shield receded slowly and I felt the temperature drop The pillow popped up into my hands and I grabbed it doing my best to steady the bed Deli pointed to a large cloud which was now directly in front of us I noticed that it was in an odd shape long in the body but still thick and there was a wisp of cloud coming out of the top 

Soy recognized it before I did It a whale he shouted 

I steered the bed upward heading for the tail We followed its curve and headed up the back I had underestimated how fast we were going and we passed right over most of the body in a few seconds 

We were almost at the head when Deli yelled Drop us down 

I pushed down hard on the pillow and we broke through the top edge of the cloud just a little past the blowhole There was a flash of white and I felt a cool wet breeze A split second later I felt warm like it was a spring day The white surrounding us turned to open space and I realized that this cloud was not solid It was hollow 

I looked down and saw green speckled with small squares and there were shapes moving around in between them on tan lines There was also a blue circle My brain searched trying to match what I was seeing with everything I knew about clouds But it was somewhere else in my mind that I found the answer What I saw reminded me of a map I was looking down at a village 

We were falling faster and longer than I would ever fallen before My stomach felt like it was inside my throat I tried yanking up on the pillow but it was not responding to my touch it felt like there was something stronger controlling it As we got closer to the bottom lights flew up from below us and began whizzing by the bed 

Do something yelled Soy I do not want to die inside a whale cloud
Deli had not moved since we entered the cloud She looked as calm as ever 

The back of the bed hit first and then the front came crashing down To my surprise water shot up from all sides and splashed down onto our heads 

Welcome to Pavidale Deli announced
