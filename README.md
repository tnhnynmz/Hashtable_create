This program aims to teach how to create hashtable data structure with using other data structures.
Main purpose of this program is basically read given text and calculate the words with their repeat
counts using hashtable data structure. We have a story text which is contains words and we have a search
text which is contains the words that needs to be found. When program finds the given word, it should
print it’s key value, count value and it’s index. If nothing is found then it must print it too.
